# Blocky - The Game

### This simple but challenging platforming game combines the steampunk style of an old factory setting, and a minimalistic and blocky platforming style to create a fun challenge for you!

### To create Blocky, our team of two divided the tasks of creating sprites and programming to create an remarkable arcade-style video game. The artworks in this project are mostly digitally drawn, with a few free images from the web for reference and the background. The programming also features an extremely realistic physics engine, calculating every bounce and rotation with precision. 
### Additionally, our programming was designed to be able to be heavily modified, allowing users to create their own levels and concepts. For example, users can create a new file based on the original level template, and change the location of the objects. They can then load that file into the LevelLoader under the Levels.tscn and share their own levels. 
## No use of artificial intelligence was used in the creation of artworks featured in this project. Minimal amounts of AI usage was used to assist with debugging a few specific lines of code.
